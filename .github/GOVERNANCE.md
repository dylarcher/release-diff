*   **Contributors:** Anyone who contributes code, documentation, or other improvements to the project.

## Decision Making

*   Most decisions are made through consensus among the maintainers.
*   Significant changes or new features are discussed via GitHub Issues or Pull Requests.

## Becoming a Maintainer
